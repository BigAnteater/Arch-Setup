# Arch-Setup
My custom Arch config

**MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BASE ARCH INSTALL FOR THIS GUIDE TO WORK.**

# Quick start

To install my Arch configs, follow this guide.

1) Clone my git repository
```
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/BigAnteater/Arch-Setup && cd Arch-Setup
```
2) Run setup.sh as root
```
sudo ./setup.sh
```
3) Once you are done running setup.sh, you will have to reboot.

4) After rebooting, you will be greeted with a login screen. Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/V3PjnodBMkU) if you need to learn how to use my DWM.

5) Open a terminal and cd back into my Arch-Setup folder.
```
cd ~/Arch-Setup
```
6) Finally, run the themes.sh
```
./themes.sh
```
7) Now, you have successfully installed my arch config. Feel free to reboot, or remove the Arch-setup folder.
